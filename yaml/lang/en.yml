    UncoupleSkillsAlternateRule: Uncouple Skills from Characteristics

    DicePoolChanceToSucceedByPermutation: Calculate the Chance to Succeed for Dice Pools
    DicePoolChanceToSucceedByPermutationHint: >-
      If enabled this will spawn a Web Worker that calculates the exact chance to succeed.
      However, if the dice pool uses a super-characteristic the calculated value is lower than the true value because it assumes that the pool doesn't explode.
      For dice pools that use super-characteristics you can get a more accurate value by using simulations.
    DicePoolChanceToSucceedBySimulation: Approximate the Chance to Succeed for Dice Pools
    DicePoolChanceToSucceedBySimulationHint: >-
      The number of simulated rolls to run in order to approximate the chance to succeed.
      Be mindful when increasing this number since it will have a direct impact on Foundry's performance; a good number to start is 100. If a value of 0 is provided this feature is disabled.
      This setting is ignored if the chance is already being calculated some other way.
    SuperCharacteristics: Super-Characteristics
    SuperCharacteristicsHint: Allows marking characteristics as being 'super' during character creation, per the Super-Characteristics optional rule (Core Rulebook, p.251).
