/**
 * Base data model shared by all Item documents.
 *
 * This class (and all subclasses) should be made abstract to deal with the way Foundry handles populating data for the schema.
 * By marking the class as abstract, TypeScript won't try to define the properties - which means Foundry is free to do as it wishes.
 * In this way, we can safely define the value types (to allow for typed access) on the data model. This works only because we never
 * have reason to instantiate any of the DataModel classes ourselves.
